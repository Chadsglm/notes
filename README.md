# Note block


Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [HTML] - creating web pages
* [CSS] - describes the style of an HTML document
* [JavaScript] - high-level, interpreted programming language
* [jQuery] - client-side scripting of HTML
* [handlebarsjs](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - semantic templates effectively
* [moment.js](moment.js) - JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)- great choices for storing data
